# A Taxonomy for Deep State Space Models (DSSMs)

This repository contains the implementation of the framework presented in our paper **"A Taxonomy for Deep State Space Models"** by Shiqin Tang, Pengxing Feng, Shujian Yu, Yining Dong, and S. Joe Qin. The paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy of deep state space models (DSSMs), categorizing them based on their conditional independence properties and exploring the integration of normalizing flows to enhance model performance.
