# A Hierarchical Taxonomy for Deep State Space Models (DSSMs)

This repository contains the implementation of the framework presented in our paper **"A Hierarchical Taxonomy for Deep State Space Models"** by Shiqin Tang, Pengxing Feng, Shujian Yu, Yining Dong, and S. Joe Qin. The paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy of deep state space models (DSSMs), categorizing them based on their conditional independence properties and exploring the integration of normalizing flows to enhance model performance.

# Abstract
Modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a challenging task in fields such as speech processing, music generation, and video prediction. This paper introduces a hierarchical framework for Deep State Space Models (DSSMs), categorizing them by their conditional independence properties and Markov assumptions and positioning existing models within this framework, including the Stochastic Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN), and Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM). We discuss different options for the inference networks and demonstrate how integrating normalizing flows can enhance model flexibility by capturing complex distributions. Our work not only clarifies the relationships among existing models but also paves the way for the development of new, more effective approaches for modeling nonlinear dynamics. In particular, we propose the Autoregressive State Space Model (ArSSM) and evaluate its effectiveness in speech and polyphonic music modeling tasks.

## Datasets

### Speech Modeling Task
To download the dataset for the speech modeling task, use the LibriSpeech dataset. Specifically, we use the `dev-clean.tar.gz` dataset, which can be downloaded from the following link:

### Polyphonic Music Generation Task
For the polyphonic music generation task, you can directly download the dataset using Python's Pyro library. Use the following code snippet to load the `JSB Chorales` dataset:

```python
import pyro.contrib.examples.polyphonic_data_loader as poly
data = poly.load_data(poly.JSB_CHORALES)
```

We would also like to thank the contributors and maintainers of PyTorch and Pyro for their excellent machine learning libraries.

Our implementation is inspired by the following works:

- [Pyro DMM Example](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/dev/examples/dmm.py): This code provides an excellent foundation for implementing deep state space models using Pyro. We adapted some of their model structures and training routines to suit our framework.
- [DVAE Implementation](https://github.com/XiaoyuBIE1994/DVAE): This implementation guided our approach to building variational autoencoders within our framework, particularly in designing inference networks.

We would like to acknowledge these contributions and thank the authors for making their code publicly available.
